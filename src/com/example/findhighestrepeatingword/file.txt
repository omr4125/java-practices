How to Find Highest Repeating Word from a File in Java
Hello guys, if you are looking for a Java program to print the word and their count
from a given file then you have come to the right place.
Earlier, I have shared 100+ Data Structure and Algorithms Problems from
interviews and in this article, I will show you how to find worlds and
their count from a given file in Java. How to find the word and their
count from a text file is another frequently asked coding question
from Java interviews. The logic to solve this problem is similar
to what we have seen in how to find duplicate words in a String,
where we iterate through string and store word and their count on
a hash table and increment them whenever we encounter the same word.
In the first step, you need to build a word Map by reading
the contents of a Text File. This Map should contain words
as a key and their count as value. Once you have this Map
ready, you can simply sort the Map based upon values.
